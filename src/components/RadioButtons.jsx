How important are lyrics to you when enjoying music?
[Radio Buttons] RadioButtons.jsx
 Very important: I pay close attention to lyrics and their meaning.
 Somewhat important: Lyrics enhance my enjoyment of music, but they're not the main focus.
 Not important: I care more about the melody and instrumentation than the lyrics.
