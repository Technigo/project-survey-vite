      "Extroverted cats love socializing with people and animals. They're lively, curious, and always seeking stimulation. When visitors come, they'll likely investigate rather than hide. In multi-pet homes, they actively seek companionship, initiating play or finding a cozy spot to snuggle.",

    description:
      "Agreeable cats are wonderfully friendly and often provide therapeutic comfort. They're the perfect companion for a cozy Netflix evening. While they may not immediately greet visitors like extroverted cats, they'll likely come to investigate, offering a gentle nudge and a soft purr. Keep them engaged with new toys for mental stimulation and overall health. Capture their joy unboxing a new toy for some delightful moments!",

    id: "impulsive",
    description:
      "An impulsive cat is known for its reckless and unpredictable behavior, especially during playtime. It's important to ensure their impulsiveness isn't a result of stress. If they have ample space and attention, it's likely just their natural disposition. Consider cat-proofing your home for their safety and consider keeping them indoors or in a secure outdoor area.",

  {
    id: "dominant",
    description:
      "A dominant cat likes to be in charge, asserting themselves even over you. In a multi-cat household, one cat may clearly take the lead, exhibiting behaviors like nudging for food or asserting dominance through playful scuffles. Consider these dynamics when adding more cats to avoid potential conflicts. If you have a dominant cat, a one-cat household might be a better fit.",
  },

  {
    id: "neurotic",
    description:
      "A neurotic cat tends to hide when visitors come, rather than just casually observing. This behavior can be due to their personality or a sign of stress. Consider a single-cat household or closely monitor interactions in a multi-cat setting. Provide them with quiet, simple toys and give them alone time to relax. Create a low-key loving home, and your neurotic cat should be fine.",
