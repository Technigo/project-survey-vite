      "Agreeable cats are wonderfully friendly and often provide therapeutic comfort. They're the perfect companion for a cozy Netflix evening. While they may not immediately greet visitors, they'll likely come to investigate, offering a gentle nudge and a soft purr. Keep them engaged with new toys for mental stimulation and overall health. Capture their joy unboxing a new toy for some delightful moments!",

    description:
      "A dominant cat likes to be in charge, asserting themselves even over you. In a multi-cat household, one cat may clearly take the lead, exhibiting behaviors like asserting dominance through playful scuffles. If you have a dominant cat, a one-cat household might be a better fit.",

    id: "extrovert",
    description:
      "Extroverted cats love socializing with people and animals. They're lively, curious and always seeking stimulation. When visitors come, they'll likely investigate rather than hide. In multi-pet homes, they actively seek companionship, initiating play or finding a cozy spot to snuggle.",

    id: "impulsive",
    description:
      "An impulsive cat is known for its reckless and unpredictable behavior, especially during playtime. It's important to ensure their impulsiveness isn't a result of stress. If they have ample space and attention, it's likely just their natural disposition. Cat-proof your home for their safety and keep them indoors or in a secure outdoor area.",

  {
    id: "neurotic",
    description:
      "A neurotic cat tends to hide when visitors come. This behavior can be due to their personality or a sign of stress. Consider a single-cat household or closely monitor interactions in a multi-cat setting. Provide them with quiet, simple toys and give them alone time to relax. Create a low-key loving home, and your neurotic cat should be fine.",
