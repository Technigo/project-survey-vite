Survey to book a mystery trip

Whats left TODO:

- styling radio buttons (tried this for about one hour and couldn't figure it out. used stuff exactly like on stackoverflow but nothing seems to work...)new day new luck ;) I was able to do the styling. However we need to check the font size again since it doesn't fit the checkmark or we just remove the checkmark
- add validation to range question (tried this with event.preventDefault which is not working yet.)
- style dropdown (arrow)
- style button/error message

DONE:

- check accessibility-> now 100 after button color change again!
- change header for after submission (done /alma)
- make grey submit button darker? to increase accessiblity (made it darker /Alma)changed the button color once again to even darker grey since the accessibility was still 91 now it's 100! :)
