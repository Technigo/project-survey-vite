# Survey Project

Create a survey using UseState hook in React. Make the survey responsive, accessible and perform a score>=95 in Lighthouse.

### The Problem

I've personalized my design and created a survey which display onne question per page. I've used UseState hook to handle imputs and finally display the result of all choices.I've used basic validation.
I'm really proud of my ternary operator, which I used to display or not the result based on the submit button(if submit or not).
