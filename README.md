# Survey Project

This weeks project was to create a survey form with at least 3 questions using React. We had to have accessability in mind and our pair aimed for a lighthouse score of 100.

# The Problem

We first decided what questions we wanted to ask and then planed our working hours for the week. We combined asynchonous work and pair-programming using live-share, pop.com and working in branches.
The design evolved during the course of time and we eventually thought it would be fun to make our "Ice-breaker-survey" for Technigo in Technigos colors and font. This was also a good way to analyze a sites elements/components/styles and to try to "follow" a design.

When we ecountered problems we reviewed code from alumni, asked chatGPT, googled and read on stack overflow. This way we managed to complete some stretch goals even though our original plan was to only complete the basics.

We are very happy with our result and we hope you are too!
