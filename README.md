# Survey Project

This week we had to create a form with react state and form control. Also to make the site with high acceibility.

### The Problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

We started to go through the given material, then we started to create the form. We struggeled how to get the answers from the form on a new page. Once that was solved we did some styling with consideration that our site would get a lighthouse score for at least 95 in accecibility, wich we got.

If we would have had more time we would focus on the streached goals and also work more with the styling.
