# Survey Project

This week we focused on react and useState. In the assigment we were asked to create a survey using useState and hook function. We worked in teams of two and our aim was to to finish the assigment in time and also working on our creativity. The react part was easier than expected which we thought were a good thing, since we could use the spare time on the design.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

We started by doing a briefly plan in Figma of our project. This was really good when we started working in branches.
To solve our problems we used google, slack, notion and other places to find the answer.

In the end we had some problems with deploying efter we merged but we find the solution in a coding site.

If we had more time we whould focus on the strechegoals and on the textcontent in our typeform so it has a better flow.
