# Survey Project

The assignment this week was to create a survey like form using react hook useSate().

Our form is called "Adopt a cat" where the user gets to select different attributes and then which cat they want. The form ends with a page that sums up all the selected attributes. In the form we use text input fields, radio buttons and a dropdown. 

### The Problem

To avoid as many problems as possible we started our project with planing in detail in Figma what the app should be about, what questions should appear and what input to use on each question. The planning made it easier for us as a team to have the same goal while coding. During the project we used a lot of different methods and aids to move forward. ChatGPT, youtube and google were our best tools. 

If we had more time we would add a function to validate each input and put out an error message. We also wanted to add a progress bar but did not have enough time.
