# Survey Project

The task was to create a survey using useState hook.

### The Problem

I wanted to create a multiple step form wizard, and it required a bit of puzzle to make sure everything was in place. I chose to do all styling using Tailwind to make it look consistent and good, but also to challenge myself to get to know every aspect of Tailwind including details as focus, ring etc.
