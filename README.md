# Survey Project

We (Emmy and Andrej) created a short superhero story generator that asks the user four questions and then displays a story based on user input.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

We started by discussing what we wanted the project to be about and how we wanted our design to look like over voice chat.
After we had a general outline for the project, we started the coding process.
Most of the work was done through pair programming using Live Share and Discord. Some parts of the project were created through branches and then merged into the main project and we should have kept doing that in hindsight as most of the later work was done in the main branch.

The project was coded using JS, React & CSS. Data is handled through the use and manipulation of the useState hook. Images were taken from external resources and creators are credited in the footer.

There was an idea of using OpenAI to generate stories in real-time, but it was quickly discarded due to cost issues.
