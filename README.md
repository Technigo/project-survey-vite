# Survey Project

Technigo project sprint 2. Working in pair with branches creating a Typeform-like "survey" by controlled forms to collect data from users using React and State.

### The Problem

As a pair we were new to using state and are relatively new to React. Problems were solved by team-work, going through course-material and chatGPT.

A sketch was made showing the structure of the components and basic design. We changed some of this to make our project more clean.

With more time we would have added the map-method to the radio buttons, validation (to require answers), e-mail input and we would also have hidden the header-information when the summary is shown.
