# Survey Project

To practice how to use the React hook useState and how to make a controlled form I created a basic survey to get feedback from people who had participated in a climbing course.

### The Problem

I used different forums to read how other people had solve similiar problems and tried to translate that into my code. I also discussed the assignment with my classmates and how they have approach different tasks in the assignment.

If I had more time, then I would have tried to do all of the stretchgoals.

### View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
