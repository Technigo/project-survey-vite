# Survey Project

We did a short and simple music survey (inspired by previous weeks project).

### The Problem

Working with components are still difficult this week and get them to pass data between components with props and manage component state using useState was even harder. Luckily we were two working on this project and we could complete what the other person couldn't.  

If we had more time we would fix this issue: 
- The user can leave questions blank with no input and continue to next questions and submit for summary.
