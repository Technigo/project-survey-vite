# Adventure in the Wild

The task was to create a Typeform-like survey using React. The survey is for an outdoor activity company where the user can choose what activity they want to sign up for.

### The Problem

I first looked at the design file provided and based the survey upon that. After writing out all the parts in the same file, I started breaking out different sections into their own compartments. A lot of time was spent on getting the validation system to work.

If I had more time I would have worked more on the styling and tried out more of the stretch goals.
