# Mushroom Survey Project
This project is a simple web application built with React, designed to practice React state and controlled forms. It functions similarly to a Typeform-like product, where users can answer a set of questions, and upon submission, they receive a summary of their answers.

## Feature⛳️
- User-friendly survey with at least 3 questions.
- Real-time updating of user answers using React state.
- Submission button to generate a summary of user responses.
## The Problem
As much as we'd love to continue expanding and improving the Mushroom Survey project, we have encountered time constraints. Our primary focus was on building a basic functional application for practicing state management and controlled forms.
