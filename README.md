# Survey Project

This project was about practising React state and controlled forms by making a Typeform-like product in the form of a quiz. The completed project should consist of at least three questions that need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

## Problem

In this project, we worked with trying to connect the different components within the survey. We also encountered several challenges related to styling and layout, such as customizing the appearance of dropdown menus to match our design. Additionally, we adjusted default styles on input fields, including removing border-radius and default borders to create a more uniform look throughout the form. By solving these issues, we improved the user experience and created a visually appealing survey application.
