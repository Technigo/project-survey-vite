# Survey Project

Goal for this week: create a survey using UseState hook in React. Make the survey responsive, accessible and perform a score>=95 in Lighthouse.

### The Problem

I've personalized my design and created a survey which display one question per page. I've used UseState hook to handle imputs and finally display the result of all choices using a ternary operator (which I'm really proud of ðŸ˜…).I've used basic validation(required) but seems not working, I'll need to fix that.
Overall I feel I'm getting along with React and not with the styling, not my personal best.
