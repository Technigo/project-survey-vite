# Survey Project

This week we created a survey using this weeks React concept useState, while making sure the website scores high in accessibility.

### The Problem

We started by writing down our questions and planned the flow of the survey. We identified the different questions and split them up in different components. We used useState complete the project and to show and hide the form and the summary of the form.

We tried to follow the provided design but we had a hard time implementing the styling for the question inputs. We also didn't manage put a validation on the range question, so we might look into solving that later.

If we had more time, we would work on more of the strech goals, probably look into displaying one question at a time.
