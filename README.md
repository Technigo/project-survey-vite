# Survey - Barbie Survey

I made a survey to book tickets to the Barbie movie, using useState and controlled forms.

### The Problem

I did sometning that the radio buttons are not highlighted when i clicked on them, I changed the value on the radio buttons, thats men the problem occured. I have not solved it due deadline. I am going to change the submit form also, adding the right CSS.
