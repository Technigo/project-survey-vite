# Survey Project

The assignment was to practise React state and controlled forms by making a Typeform-like product. Accessibility was also a focus.

### The Problem

The main new concept to learn was the useState hook. This was my first experience with a React hook. I also learned how to use âŒ˜-F5 to start VoiceOver and check the page's screen reader accessible. And I ran the page through the Lighthouse accessibility audit, which it got 100%.

In the CSS, I wanted to style all three of my different input field types together using one block of code. But when I added padding to them, they all became different widths. I learned about using a [box-sizing reset](https://css-tricks.com/box-sizing/) to fix that.
