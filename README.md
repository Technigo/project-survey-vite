# Survey Project

We wanted to make a form with three different questions using three different ways of input. When submitting the form the user is presented with a short story created based on the users answers.

### The Problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

This project is built using React and styled with CSS. We made a form with a text input, a dropdown and radio buttons. The inputs are passed and used in an summary answer. For this project we also worked with accessibility and the goal was to make the form easy to use even for people with dissabilities.

Next step would be to dig deeper into how to style the dropdown and the radio buttons using CSS.
