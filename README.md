# Survey Project

A short survey to practise useStatement in React and to aim for a high accessibility score in Lighthouse. A simple looking but still challenging task!

### The Problem

We started off with a different folder structure, one that was slightly more advanced than the current one. After some time, we re-aranged it to make it more understandable for everyone in the team and we got it rolling again. Why we chose our first model was because we figured it'd be easier to build on in the future to make a bigger survey from it, as a template sort of.
