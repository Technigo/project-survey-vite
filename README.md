# Survey Project

This is a site conducting a survey of the users favorite ice cream.

### The Problem

We started out pretty straight forward and had great teamwork with how we wanted to set up the survey, and how the functionality should work. It went super smoothly, the only bumps we've encountered were when we wanted to fix the responsiveness (which was a harder task than we originaly planned, since we used a background image), and when we wanted to make sure all required fields had to have been filled in before being able to press the submit button, since nothing was actually submitted. But we managed to make it work despite only working two days.
