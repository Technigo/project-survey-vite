## Survey Project

The assingment for week six was to create an interactive survey; we decided to focus on knowing our users stress levels and their way to cope with it. At the end of the survey we suggest them alternative ways to reduce stress levels.

## The Problem

We first drafted the UI for the mobile in Figma. Then we started creating components to break down the project into reuseable parts. We did the multi-step form in the Question component and used the ternary conditions to check which question to render. Lastly, we built validation functions to ensure the email is in the valid format as well as other input fields are not empty.

If we had more time, we would like to add a button that jumps to the previous page and a start-over button that restarts the survey.
