# Survey Project

Created a Harry Potter survey using controlled form inputs and useState in React. I used the provided survey design to replicate as close as possible.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

I first created the survey form in one component. After that, I broke out the survey into muliple componenets. I had some trouble creating the custom radio button and the radio input, but used past projects and the web to solve it.

### View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
