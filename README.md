# Survey Project

Practiced React state & controlled forms via Typeform-like project.


## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

I created SurveyForm functional component with useState hook to manage form data (formData) and submission status (submitted). I designed form structure with input fields and buttons. Implemented event handlers (handleChange and handleSubmit) to capture user input and handle form submission. I defined submission logic in handleSubmit function to update submitted state upon form submission. In the end I rendered submission summary with collected data for user confirmation.
