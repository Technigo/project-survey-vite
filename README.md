# Survey Project

We was suppose to build a survey with 3 question containing a dropdown, radio buttons, submit button and a summary.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

We had continua problems while trying to push to git, we pushed from githubs site instead.
