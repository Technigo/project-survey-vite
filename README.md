# Survey Project
The assignment was to do a survey and since both Ulrika and I love christmas, we thought a christmas survey would be fun to do.

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem
This was one of the first weeks with React. The biggest issue we had was firstly, what questions and later on when we wanted to bring on the slider how to implement it actually knowing the level. That took some time. We also struggled a bit with the path to the image and that one we actually solved afterwards.
