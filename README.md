# Survey Project

To practice how to use the React hook useState and how to make a controlled form I created a basic survey to get feedback from people who had participated in a climbing course.

### The Problem

I used different forums to read how other people had solve similiar problems and tried to translate that into my code. I also discussed the assignment with my classmates and how they have approach different tasks in the assignment.

If I had more time, then I would have tried to do all of the stretchgoals.
