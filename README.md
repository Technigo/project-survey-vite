# Survey Project

This weeks project was to create a survey with a minimum of three questions, and at the end it was supposed to show a summary of the choices that had been made. The focus was on practising React and keeping accessibility in mind.

This project was a pair project done by Vera Witting and Anna Robertsson.


### The Problem

We first made a function in the Form.jsx to respond to the user after the survey. Then we wanted to put it in a new component, and had som struggle with the data flow. We solved it working together through trouble shooting with console.logs to grasp where it didn't work. 

We also had some issues with styling, especially concerning accessability, since this was the first time for us thinking in those terms. Anna solved it by studying requirements, and we corrected the code to follow that.

If we had more time, we would have spent it on creating more options for each destination in the suggestions array, and use a map method instead of .find(), and add a randomizer to present a destination suggestion. 

We would also have wanted to spend more time on the styling.
