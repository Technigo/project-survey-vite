# Survey Project

Week 6 project is about creating a survey/ form and practice useState. Main requirements were at least 3 questions, one radio button question and one selection dropdown.

### The Problem

We started of gathering some ideas for a survey. We used AI to help us to get inspired.
After we setteled for a topic and defined the questions and answer, we started to define all the states and events.
Later we tried to create a result page that is returning the chosen answer.
