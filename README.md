# Survey Project

Made a pirate name generator who takes the users input to select random values who fit the user input.

the user fills out a form with their name,picks their favorite element from a dropdown, check off a checkbox if they are older than 25, and selects their passion in life with radiobuttons. These inputs are then checked for their value, and a random word for each type is the chosen.

after the user have filled in their form, the form is hidden and the user is presented with a summary of their input and their new pirate name.

### The Problem

I quickly decided I wanted to have some fun with the inputs, and used some time to figure out how to use the input to display a random result each time.
In retrospect, I should probably just focused on the streach goals instead of making pirate names.
