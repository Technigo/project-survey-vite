# Survey Project

The assignment was to build a survey form using React useState with at least three questions and some type of summary after the user clicks submit.

### The Problem

I carefully watched Diego's code session to get the basic code structure and understand how the different components work. Then, as usual, it was a lot of googling, AI, and W3Schools to get the project working and looking pretty decent. And a little tweaking of CSS as icing on the cake. If I had more time I would build more components with other input types.
