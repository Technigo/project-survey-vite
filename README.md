# Survey Project

We were tasked with creating a survey. It could be about anything, ours naturally being about weird pizza toppings.
The learning goals were to get a better understanding of useState in React as well as working on accessability.


### The Problem

We started by having a strategy meeting. Tried to lay out the plan going forward as best we could. We had to tweak out plans along the way but we got pretty close.

If we had more time we would add the stretch goal version of having one question displayed at the time.
