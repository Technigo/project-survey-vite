# Survey Project

This week we had to create a form with react using state. We also needed to make sure the site was created with high accessibility.

### The Problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

We started to go through the given material, then we started to create the form. We struggeled with how to create a function to get the answers(data/values) from the form showing on a new page luckaly Jennie helped us with that during the Q&A. Once the form worked we tried splitting up the form into smaller components to different files so it would look cleaner but didnt manage to make it work so we decided to stick with one file for all the questions and answers. 

If we would have had more time we would focus on the streach goals and also work more with the styling and responsiveness in css.
