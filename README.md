# Survey Project
## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem


### View it live

https://stunning-faloodeh-3e176a.netlify.app/ - as of now I'm not getting the header to work, it works locally and I'm sure this is regular issue.
