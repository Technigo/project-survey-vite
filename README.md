# Survey Project

Week 6 - Technigo Web Development Bootcamp - Porject Survey

Paired Project - Beckie Morton and Elin Olausson


## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

Describe how you approached to problem: 

Learning content was less this week and concepts covered were not as difficult for us as last week. Now that we have expereince manipulating a react project and boilerplate we were able to start the project with little issues.

Code sessions and Q&A helped a lot and we are grateful for the code snippets that created next/back buttons.

The most difficult section was to get the survey to disappear and be replaced by the results section. We were able to solve this by using a hideQuiz variable which we put into the submitForm function inside SurveryForm.jsx.

How did you plan? 
We drew a simple diagram for our parent to child structure.
We created a simple site design layout

What technologies did you use? 
HTML5
CSS3
React
Editor: VS Code

If you had more time, what would be next?

The results page needs a re-styling! It needs images to make it look like a "poster" as the site suggests.
WE would have also loved to have made it more user friendly for our target demographic (children aged 4-10), having clickable images (eg. on the favourite dinosaur page.
